Not on day one for a small app. Before the second team joins, always.",

A dropped column breaks the old code still running during a rolling deploy. A new index locks writes unless it's created concurrently. A rename is two deploys, not one. We write migrations as backwards-compatible steps, separate schema changes from data changes, and test them against a copy of production volume rather than an empty database.",
