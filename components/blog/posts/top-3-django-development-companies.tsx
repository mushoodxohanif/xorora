    q: "What should I look for in a Django development company?",
    a: "Real production experience with Django REST Framework or GraphQL, a documented approach to version upgrades and testing, and clarity on who will actually write your code. If your project has any AI or data component, ask directly whether the team handles that in-house or would need a second vendor.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to hire a Django web development company?",
    a: "Cost depends heavily on scope. A scoped API or admin system can start in the low five figures, while a full-stack platform with a custom frontend, third-party integrations, and AI features runs significantly higher. Get a written estimate against your specific requirements rather than comparing headline rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a Django development agency and a freelance Django developer?",
    a: "A freelancer covers one set of hands and one discipline. An agency typically brings backend engineers, QA, and project management together, so project continuity doesn't depend on a single person's availability. For anything beyond a narrow, well-defined task, an agency is usually the safer choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Django still a good choice for a new web project in 2026?",
    a: "Yes. Django's batteries-included approach, strong security defaults, and mature ecosystem remain a solid foundation for content-heavy sites, internal tools, SaaS backends, and increasingly, applications with an AI or data layer built in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Xorora a good choice among Django development companies?",
    a: "Xorora has an in-house Django team building production applications, including Django REST Framework APIs and Django paired with AI/ML features, alongside its broader full-stack and AI engineering practice. It's a strong fit for companies that want Django development handled by a team that also brings API, data, and AI capability to the same engagement rather than a narrowly scoped Django-only vendor. Projects start at $10,000, with pricing quoted directly against scope.",
