  {
    q: "What's the difference between a Java development company and a JavaScript development company?",
    a: "Java and JavaScript are unrelated languages despite the similar name. A Java development company builds JVM-based backend systems, enterprise software, and Android apps using Java or Kotlin. A JavaScript development company builds browser-based frontends and, often via Node.js, JavaScript-based backends. Confirm which one you actually need before requesting proposals, since the naming overlap causes real mix-ups.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Java still a good choice for a new startup in 2026?",
    a: "Yes, particularly for FinTech, logistics, security, and other domains where correctness and long-term maintainability matter more than the fastest possible first launch. Modern Java (17/21+) with Spring Boot 3 and Virtual Threads is a meaningfully different, more productive language than the Java most people picture.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to hire a custom Java development company?",
    a: "Rates vary widely by region and specialization. Architecture-first consultancies and framework-authorship-level firms tend to price at a premium, while full-cycle product shops in Eastern Europe and similar regions offer more startup-friendly rates. Get a written estimate against your specific scope rather than comparing headline hourly rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I look for in a Java web application development company?",
    a: "Real production experience with modern Java (17/21+), demonstrated Spring Boot or lightweight-framework depth, clean API design discipline, and a documented testing strategy. If your roadmap includes AI or data features, ask directly whether the team handles that in-house.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Xorora a good choice among Java development companies?",
    a: "Xorora has an in-house team building Java and Spring Boot applications, alongside its broader AI, .NET, Python, Node.js, and Laravel engineering practice. It's a strong fit for startups that want Java development handled by a team that also brings AI, data, and full-stack capability to the same engagement, rather than a narrowly scoped Java-only vendor. Projects start at $10,000, with pricing quoted directly against scope.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a Java software company and a Java outsourcing company?",
    a: "The terms are often used interchangeably, but \"software company\" typically implies product-focused, end-to-end delivery, while \"outsourcing company\" often implies staff augmentation or capacity extension for an existing team. Clarify which model you actually need, since pricing, ownership, and engagement structure differ meaningfully between the two.",

        Java in 2026 isn&apos;t the language most people picture. The mental
        image is still Java 8: verbose XML configuration, boilerplate getters
        and setters, and enterprise systems that feel a decade behind. Modern
        Java, records, sealed interfaces, pattern matching, virtual threads,
        reads a lot closer to Kotlin or C# than to Java circa 2014.

        It&apos;s also not the default choice for every product. An e-commerce

        JavaScript or Python stack. But in FinTech, logistics, security, and
        other domains where correctness, predictable latency, and long-term
        maintainability matter more than speed of first launch, the JVM remains
        a serious default, and demand for a capable{" "}

        Java still sits inside the top tier of the TIOBE Index and remains one

        Quick clarification: Java vs JavaScript
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Before the list, one thing worth addressing directly, because it trips up
        more buyers than you&apos;d expect: Java and JavaScript are different
        languages, related in name only. Java is a statically typed, compiled
        language running on the JVM, commonly used for backend systems,
        enterprise software, and Android. JavaScript is the language of the web
        browser, used heavily on the frontend and, via Node.js, on the backend
        too.
      </p>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-10")}>
        If you&apos;re specifically looking for a{" "}
        <strong className="font-semibold text-fg1">

        <strong className="font-semibold text-fg1">
          javascript software development company
        </strong>{" "}
        more broadly, that&apos;s a different search than what this article
        covers. Every company profiled below builds with Java (JVM-based backend
        systems, Spring Boot, enterprise applications), not JavaScript. Worth a
        30-second gut-check before you request a proposal, since the naming
        overlap causes real confusion in RFPs.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-java-work-means" className={h2Class}>
        What &quot;Java work&quot; actually means for a startup
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-4")}>
        For most modern companies, Java engagement usually falls into one of a
        few buckets:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-5 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 font-sans text-[16.5px] text-fg2 leading-[1.75]">
        {JAVA_WORK_BUCKETS.map((item) => (

        ))}
      </ul>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-10")}>
        And &quot;Java development company&quot; itself covers very different
        types of providers: large enterprise vendors with unlimited budgets,
        architecture-first consultancies for high-stakes system design, boutique
        senior teams priced at a premium, and full-cycle product shops that
        design, build, and ship end-to-end at more accessible rates. Knowing
        which type you actually need matters more than any single ranking.

        Every company on this list can write solid Java code. What actually
        separates a good hire from an expensive mismatch is whether their

        compliance depth, or AI-integrated engineering, matches what your
        project needs next, not just what a homepage claims. If you&apos;re
