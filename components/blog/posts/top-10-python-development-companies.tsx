  {
    q: "What is the average Python developer hourly rate in the USA?",
    a: "There's no single figure. Python developers can be hired as employees, freelancers, or through a development company, and agency rates fold in project management, QA, and overhead that a freelance rate doesn't.",

    q: "Which is the best Python development company?",
    a: "It depends on the project. Some companies specialize in Python and AI specifically, while others offer Python inside a broader enterprise software practice.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good Django development company?",
    a: "Look for a company with real, referenceable Django projects rather than one that simply lists Django among its technologies. Several companies in this comparison, including Uvik and ScienceSoft, name Django directly in their service offering.",

    q: "Is FastAPI a good choice for business applications?",
    a: "FastAPI works well for APIs, backend services, and microservices. Whether it's the right choice depends on your architecture and performance requirements.",

    q: "How much does a Python project actually cost?",
    a: "Total cost depends on scope, team size, complexity, integrations, and what happens after launch, not just the hourly rate.",

        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        There is no single best Python development company for every project.
        Some, like Xorora and Uvik, are built specifically around Python and AI
        engineering. Others, like ELEKS and Grid Dynamics, offer Python as part
        of a much larger enterprise engineering practice.
      </p>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Rates across this list run from a few thousand dollars for a scoped
        project up to $150–199 an hour at the premium end, with minimum
        engagement sizes ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 or more. For a small or
        early-stage build, minimum project size and responsiveness often matter
        more than brand size. For a large enterprise system, technical depth and
        long-term support usually matter more than the headline rate.
      </p>
      <p className={bodyClass}>
        Before committing, compare the actual team you&apos;ll work with,
        relevant case studies, framework expertise, and what happens after
        launch, not just the number on the rate card.
