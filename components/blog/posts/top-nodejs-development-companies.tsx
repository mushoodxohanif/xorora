  {
    q: "How much does Node.js development cost in 2026?",
    a: "A basic Node.js REST API with authentication and database integration typically runs $8,000–25,000. A full-stack Node.js application with a React or Next.js frontend and a production deployment pipeline runs $30,000–100,000. Enterprise-grade platforms with microservices, event-driven design, and multi-region deployment run $100,000–500,000 or more. Hourly rates span roughly $25–49/hr at Eastern European and specialist studios, $50–99/hr at mid-tier consultancies, and $100–200/hr at premium US and UK agencies.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a Node.js project take to build?",
    a: "A basic API typically takes four to eight weeks. A full-stack Node.js application with a frontend runs three to five months. A production-grade microservices platform with event-driven architecture and full monitoring infrastructure can take six to twelve months.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I look for in a Node.js development company?",
    a: "Production deployments at real scale, not internal tools or demos. Direct experience with event-driven architecture, WebSockets, or microservices if your project needs them. A single team covering backend and frontend, or a clearly defined handoff process if not. Standard monitoring, logging, and alerting as part of delivery, not an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Node.js the right choice for my backend?",
    a: "Node.js fits real-time applications (chat, live dashboards, collaborative tools), API-first architectures serving multiple clients, high-concurrency services, and streaming data pipelines well. It's a weaker fit for CPU-intensive workloads like video encoding, where Python or Go tend to perform better, and for traditional server-rendered sites where a framework like Rails may be simpler. For most modern SaaS, mobile-backend, and API-driven products, it's a sound choice with a deep talent pool.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Xorora a good choice for Node.js development?",
    a: "Xorora builds Node.js APIs and real-time, event-driven systems for startups and mid-market companies, including a real-time SaaS event monitoring platform, a real-time compliance intelligence system, and a multi-portal SaaS backend serving four role-specific portals. Engagements start at $10,000, and pricing is quoted directly against project scope rather than published as a fixed hourly range.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between hiring a Node.js developer and a Node.js development company?",
    a: "An individual developer covers one discipline. A development company typically brings backend engineers, frontend developers, QA, project management, and DevOps together. For a full-stack product, a company is usually the safer hire; for a narrow, well-specified backend task, a strong individual freelancer can be enough.",

  "What's included in your production deployment setup by default? Containerization, CI/CD, environment configuration, monitoring and alerting, and load testing before go-live should all be standard, not extras.",
  "What Node.js version do you build on, and how do you manage LTS upgrade cycles? A team with genuine production depth will have a documented upgrade process and know which recent breaking changes affected their clients.",
  "Who is actually writing the code on my project at month three, not month one? Ask for engineer names and current project history. Senior-team pitches followed by a mid-level handoff after signing is one of the most common sources of delivery problems in this category.",

        backend services, which is exactly why the range of &quot;Node.js

        Express app for a static API and a team that built an event-driven
        system handling tens of thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections
        both describe themselves as Node.js specialists. Verifying which one

        The question that actually determines fit
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Every company on this list can write working Node.js code. What
        separates a good hire from a bad one is whether the engagement type
        matches what you&apos;re actually buying.
      </p>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        A backend component is a Node.js API consumed by a frontend, mobile, or
        integration team you manage separately. You need clean documentation and
        a spec-to-delivery process. Cleveroad, Relevant Software, and Sloboda
        Studio are built for this.
      </p>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        A full-stack product build means the Node.js backend and the frontend
        ship from one team on a shared brief, which removes the integration
        handoff risk entirely. Xorora, Intellectsoft, and Miquido operate this
        way, at different scale and price points.
      </p>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        An enterprise engineering program means Node.js sits inside a larger
        modernization or platform rebuild, with governance and multi-team
        coordination most mid-size studios can&apos;t sustain over a multi-year
        engagement. EPAM and ScienceSoft are built for that scope.
      </p>
      <p className={bodyClass}>
        Node.js is used in production backend systems across a large share of
        enterprise organizations today, which means the talent pool is wide but
        the skill range within any single &quot;Node.js experience&quot; claim
        is wider than ever. A team that shipped one static API has technically
        used Node.js. A team that built an event-driven system handling tens of
        thousands of concurrent connections is operating in a different category
        entirely. Verifying which one you&apos;re hiring is the actual
        procurement problem.

        The names that show up most often in Node.js shortlists aren&apos;t
        necessarily the strongest ones. They&apos;re the ones with the biggest
        content and ad budgets. The signal worth trusting is a live production
        deployment that matches your actual project type, not repeated placement
        across every &quot;top&quot; list on the internet.
