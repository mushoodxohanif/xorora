  },
  {
    q: "How much do Python application development services cost?",
    a: "Cost depends primarily on scope: application complexity, framework choice, integrations, and whether AI/ML features are involved. A scoped API or internal tool costs meaningfully less than a full-stack SaaS platform with billing and third-party integrations. Get a written estimate against your specific requirements rather than relying on a generic price range.",

  {
    q: "Which Python framework should I use for my application?",
    a: "Django suits full-featured web applications and platforms with complex data models. FastAPI is the stronger choice for modern, high-performance APIs and microservices. Flask fits smaller applications where you want more architectural control. The right choice depends on your project's specific requirements, not a universal best answer.",

  {
    q: "What should I look for in a Python app development company?",
    a: "Real production experience with the framework your project needs, a documented testing and deployment process, and clarity on how AI or data features fit in if your roadmap includes them. Ask for examples of applications currently running in production, not just a portfolio of demos.",

        Python has quietly become the default starting point for a huge range of

      <h2 id="what-is-python-application-development" className={h2Class}>
        What is Python application development?
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Python application development is the process of building software, web
        applications, backend systems, automation tools, or data-driven products
        using Python as the core programming language. Python&apos;s appeal comes
        down to a few consistent strengths: readable, concise syntax that speeds
        up development and long-term maintenance, a mature standard library, and
        one of the largest open-source ecosystems in software, covering
        everything from web frameworks to machine learning libraries.
      </p>
      <p className={bodyClass}>
        That combination is why Python shows up across such a wide range of use
        cases. A team doesn&apos;t need to switch languages between building a
        REST API, automating a data pipeline, and prototyping a machine
        learning model. That consistency matters more than it sounds like on
        paper: it reduces hiring complexity, simplifies onboarding, and keeps a
        smaller team productive across more of the stack, which is a large part
        of why Xorora structures its own{" "}
        <TextLink href={ROUTES.engineering}>engineering practice</TextLink>{" "}
        around Python as a connective layer between application code and AI/ML
        work, rather than treating them as separate disciplines.
      </p>

      <h2 id="python-frameworks" className={h2Class}>
        Python frameworks worth knowing in 2026
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-6")}>
        Framework choice shapes almost everything about a Python
        project&apos;s architecture, so it&apos;s worth understanding what each
        one is actually built for.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3Class}>Django</h3>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Django remains the standard choice for full-featured web applications
        and platforms that need a lot out of the box: an ORM, an admin interface,
        authentication, and a strong security posture by default. It suits
        content-heavy sites, SaaS platforms, and applications with complex data
        models.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3Class}>FastAPI</h3>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        FastAPI has become the go-to for modern, high-performance APIs. Built
        around Python&apos;s async capabilities and automatic OpenAPI
        documentation, it&apos;s a strong fit for microservices, mobile app
        backends, and any system where request throughput matters — and
        it&apos;s one of the frameworks behind Xorora&apos;s own{" "}

        work.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3Class}>Flask</h3>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Flask is a lightweight microframework for smaller applications or
        services that don&apos;t need Django&apos;s full feature set. It gives a
        team more architectural control at the cost of having to assemble more
        pieces manually.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3Class}>Kivy and BeeWare</h3>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-5")}>
        Kivy and BeeWare extend Python into cross-platform mobile and desktop UI
        development, letting teams write once and target Android, iOS, and
        desktop from a shared Python codebase — useful for internal tools and
        certain consumer apps where a fully native experience isn&apos;t a hard
        requirement.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3Class}>Celery</h3>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-10")}>
        Celery handles asynchronous task queues and background job processing, a
        near-standard component in Python applications that need to offload heavy
        or time-delayed work (sending emails, processing uploads, running
        scheduled jobs) outside the main request cycle.

        Where Python application development actually fits
      </h2>
      <p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-4")}>
        Python isn&apos;t the right tool for every project, but it&apos;s a

        The common thread: Python performs best when a project needs to move
